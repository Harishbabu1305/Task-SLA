            <h2> ABOUT US </h2>
            <p> Cats and dogs, though both popular furry pets with four legs and a tail, differ significantly in their social needs,
                 independence, and typical behaviors. Dogs are often seen as loyal, social, and dependent, thriving on companionship 
                 and requiring more active attention and space. Cats, on the other hand, are known for their independence and ability
                  to entertain themselves, preferring solitary pursuits and needing less hands-on care but still requiring love and a 
                  stimulating environment. While historical and natural instincts might suggest antagonism, dogs and cats can form 
                  strong bonds and live harmoniously with proper socialization and introductions.  </p>
